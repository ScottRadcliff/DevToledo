#Dev Toledo

DevToledo.com is an application to connect developers from different background for one common purpose, learning. There are several small groups of developers dedicated to a particular language or technology (.NET, Java, Rails, etc...). DevToledo aims to connect them all to teach and learn from each other.

If you are semi-local to the Toledo Ohio area and would like to contribute, fork the project and start coding. Any code submitted must have an accompanying test. Test methods or frameworks are up to the developer, but here is a list of current gems being used for testing.

* [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber)
* [Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl)
* [Rspec](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec)
* [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara)

We are still hammering out details about meeting locations and dates. Visit [DevToledo.com](http://devtoledo.com) to sign up for email updates.
